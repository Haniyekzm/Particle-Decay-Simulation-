## Overview
This project simulates **particle decay over time** using **Euler’s method**.
The code models the decay process and generates a plot of the number of remaining
particles as a function of time.

## Features
- Numerical simulation of particle decay
- Implementation of Euler’s method for solving the decay differential equation
- Visualization of the number of remaining particles over time
- Provides an intuitive understanding of exponential decay
